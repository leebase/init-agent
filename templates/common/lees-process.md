# Lee's Process — Working with AI Agents

> **Human-AI collaboration protocol for {{PROJECT_NAME}}**

---

## Session Lifecycle

### 1. Start of Session

**Human does:**
- Review `WHERE_AM_I.md` for current state
- Identify the next task from `sprint-plan.md`
- Open editor/terminal and start AI agent

**AI does:**
- Read `agent.md` for guardrails
- Read `WHERE_AM_I.md` for context
- Read relevant code and documentation
- Ask clarifying questions if needed

### 2. During Session

**AI execution pattern:**
1. Understand the task and constraints
2. Plan approach (explain briefly)
3. Implement incrementally
4. Test as you go
5. Update documentation

**Communication:**
- Be specific about file paths and changes
- Flag blockers immediately
- Ask for human input on decisions

### 3. End of Session

**AI must update:**
- [ ] `WHERE_AM_I.md` — what was done, what's next
- [ ] `sprint-plan.md` — mark tasks complete
- [ ] `result-review.md` — log results (if significant)

**Format for updates:**
```markdown
## {{DATE}} — Brief description

What was done:
- Change 1
- Change 2

Next steps:
- Next task

Blockers:
- Any issues?
```

## File Update Requirements

### Must Update Every Session

| File | What to add |
|------|-------------|
| `WHERE_AM_I.md` | Session summary, current state |
| `sprint-plan.md` | Task completion status |

### Update When Significant

| File | When to update |
|------|----------------|
| `result-review.md` | Major milestones, completed features |
| `architecture.md` | New technical decisions |
| `agent.md` | New guardrails or patterns |

## Communication Style

### Human to AI

- **Task format**: "Do X. Constraints: Y. Output to Z."
- **Context**: Reference relevant files, decisions
- **Priority**: Mark urgent tasks clearly

### AI to Human

- **Status updates**: Concise, specific
- **Blockers**: Immediate, with context
- **Results**: File paths, commands to verify

## Definition of Done

A task is done when:

1. Code works (tests pass, if applicable)
2. Documentation updated
3. `WHERE_AM_I.md` reflects new state
4. Human can pick up where AI left off

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Check project status
cat WHERE_AM_I.md

# See recent work
cat result-review.md | head -50

# Current sprint tasks
cat sprint-plan.md

# Make git commit
git add -A && git commit -m "description"
```
